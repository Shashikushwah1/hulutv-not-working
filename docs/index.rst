A weak or unstable connection is often the culprit behind Hulu TV not working. Follow these steps:

Restart your router/modem ‚Äì Unplug it for 30 seconds, plug it back in, and wait until reconnecting.

Temporarily pause other devices ‚Äì Reduce bandwidth usage by limiting other household devices.

2. Confirm Hulu‚Äôs Server Status

Sometimes the problem isn‚Äôt your end. Hulu might be having an outage:

Search for ‚ÄúHulu status‚Äù or check third-party outage trackers.

If Hulu is down, there's nothing you can do except wait for them to fix it.

When Hulu is working, it‚Äôs more likely a device-specific issue on your end.

10. Power Cycle Your Device

A full power cycle clears system glitches:
